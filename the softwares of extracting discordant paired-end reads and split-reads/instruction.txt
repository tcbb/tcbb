samblaster is a fast and flexible program for marking duplicates in read-id grouped1 paired-end SAM files. It can also optionally 
output discordant read pairs and/or split read mappings to separate SAM files, and/or unmapped/clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file. When marking duplicates,
samblaster will require approximately 20MB of memory per 1M read pairs.
